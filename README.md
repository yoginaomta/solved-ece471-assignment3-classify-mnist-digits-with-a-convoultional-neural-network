Classify mnist digits with a convoultional neural network. Get at least 95.5% <strong>   </strong>accuracy on the test test.

<strong>008         </strong><strong>Problem Statement      </strong>Consider the mnist dataset consisting of 50,000 training

<strong>009</strong>

images, and 10,000 test images. Each instance is a 28 28 pixel handwritten digit

<strong>010                                                                                                                              </strong>×

<strong>011           </strong>zero through nine. Train a convolutional neural network for classification using

<strong>012          </strong>the training set that achieves at least 95.5% accuracy on the test set. Do not

<strong>013 </strong>explicitly tune hyperparameters based on the test set performance, use a validation

<strong>014</strong>

<strong>015          </strong>set taken from the training set as discussed in class. Use dropout and an <em>L</em><sup>2 </sup>penalty

<strong>016          </strong>for regularization. Note: if you write a sufficiently general program the next

<strong>017 </strong>assignment will be very easy.

<strong>018</strong>

<strong><sup>019            </sup></strong>Do not use the built in mnist data class from tensorflow.

<strong>Extra challenge (optional)    </strong>In addition to the above, the student with the fewest

<strong>023</strong>

<strong>024           </strong>number of parameters for a network that gets at least 80% accuracy on the test set

<strong><sup>025            </sup></strong>will receive a prize. There will be an extra prize if any one can achieve 80% on the

<strong>026</strong>

test set with a single digit number of parameters. For this extra challenge you can

<strong>027</strong>

<strong>028          </strong>make your network have any crazy kind of topology you’d like, it just needs to be <strong><sup>029           </sup></strong>optimized by a gradient based algorithm.
